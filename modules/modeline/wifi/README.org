** Usage

Place the following in your ~/.stumpwmrc file:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
    (load-module "wifi")
#+END_SRC

Then you can use "%I" in your mode line format (both "w" and "W"
were taken. Think _I_EEE 802.11 :-)).

** Notes
This gets information through sysfs, so it only works on Linux with a
mounted =sysfs=.

* WARNING

This triggers a yet to be discovered bug in SBCL, which causes
stumpwm to freeze.
 

<2014-03-16 Sun> This is a fairly old file, maybe the bug was fixed?
Can someone confirm?
