** Commentary
Window tags. Window tags are special window properties (stored in
X11 window properties) that can be used for window
manipulations. They can survive temporary WM change and allow more
flexible classification of windows than selecting window groups for
them.
** Usage
Add this to your =.stumpwmrc=:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(load-module "windowtags")
#+END_SRC
